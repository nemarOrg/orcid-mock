# orcid-mock

An ephemeral mock of the Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) service for tests and continuous integration:
the OAuth 2.0 authorization-code flow, OpenID Connect, and the public record API,
with users defined in a JSON file and all state kept in memory.

Status: charter and design only. No implementation yet.
See [`.context/plan.md`](.context/plan.md) for the roadmap and [`.context/research.md`](.context/research.md) for the findings behind it.

## Why

ORCID's sandbox is shared, cannot be reset from an API, delivers mail only to one throwaway provider, and needs real accounts,
so nobody can drive a brand-new ORCID sign-up from an automated test.
No open-source project mocks ORCID's identity layer and its record API together:
ORCID retired its own mock in 2012, and the generic OAuth and OpenID Connect mocks would still need the whole ORCID surface built on top.

## What it will do (MVP1)

- The authorization-code flow with an auto-consent page, a `login_as` shortcut for headless drivers, exact `redirect_uri` matching, and an unmodified `state` round trip.
- The token endpoint with ORCID's non-standard response (`orcid` and `name` alongside the access token), refresh tokens, and ORCID's error shapes (`invalid_grant`, `invalid_token`, `invalid_scope`).
- OpenID Connect: discovery document, JWKS, an RS256 ID token whose `sub` is the iD, and userinfo.
- Every public read endpoint of the v3.0 API that is a projection of a user: `record`, `person`, `personal-details`, `email`, `employments`, `educations`, `works` and `works/{put-codes}`, `fundings`, `keywords`, `external-identifiers`, `researcher-urls`, `biography`, `activities`,
  with per-item visibility, verified and primary flags on emails, stable put-codes, the summary-then-detail round trip, `Accept` negotiation with 406, and 413 above 100 put-codes.
- Checksum-valid iDs (ISO 7064 MOD 11-2) generated for fixtures.
- Ephemeral by construction: `POST /__admin/reset`, `POST /__admin/users`, `GET /__admin/health`, a fixed `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, one process or one container per job.

## What comes after (MVP2)

Member-API writes for works and employments, the hosted multi-tenant service, XML and other representations, webhooks, rate-limit emulation.

## How it will be used

```yaml
services:
  orcid:
    image: ghcr.io/nemarorg/orcid-mock:latest
    ports: ["9700:9700"]
    env:
      PUBLIC_BASE_URL: http://localhost:9700
      USERS_FILE: /fixtures/users.json
    options: --health-cmd "wget -qO- http://localhost:9700/__admin/health" --health-interval 5s --health-retries 10
```

Point your application at it with the same variables you use for the sandbox
(for NEMAR: `ORCID_API_BASE` and `ORCID_PUB_API_BASE`).
